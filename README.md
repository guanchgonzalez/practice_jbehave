# Practice Test with Maven and JBehave

Implement a test case to search for a keyword on Google home page using jBehave (framework for Behaviour-Driven Development).

1. Create new Maven Project.
2. Add all required dependencies to project.
3. Create required JBehave story in the package.
4. Create required a Java class in the package.
5. Use at least the "Given, Then, When" annotations in story.
6. Write a scenario using JBehave.
7. Implement a test case to open google home page and search for keyword "JBehave".
8. If the results include string "What is JBehave?" , test case succeeded. And failed otherwise.

**_Note:_** You can configure chrome driver in order to open google page. You might also need more libraries to be configured.

**_Expected Output:_** Documentation of the exercise and link to github or project zip file.


# Deployment

You must ensure that both commands work for your non-root user:

```
java -version
mvn -version
```

In the path of your choice clone this GitHub repository:

```git clone git@github.com:guanchgonzalez/practice_jbehave.git```

To force the download of all the required libraries from the [Maven Repository](https://mvnrepository.com/) execute these commands:

```
mvn clean
mvn compile
mvn dependency:tree
mvn install
```

At this point you will have already noticed a compilation error before performing the JBehave scenario: a **NoSuchMethodError** when loading the _com.google.common.collect.ImmutableMap_ method. This is a known conflict between dependent libraries that remains unresolved on Maven v3.9.2, as you can check on this [StackOverFlow article](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/71095560/java-lang-nosuchmethoderror-com-google-common-collect-immutablemap-error-when).

The issue was fixed on com.google.guava:guava:[30.1-jre](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.google.guava/guava/30.1-jre) library, which is the dependent version for the com.google.inject:guice:[5.0.0](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.google.inject/guice/5.0.0) version and following, but the last JAR file available to download in the Maven repository (compatible with the latest available org.apache.maven:maven-core is the [3.6.0](https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/apache/maven/maven-core/3.6.0/) version by the way) is the [4.2.3-no_aop](https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/com/google/inject/guice/4.2.3/). The dependent version downloaded by `mvn` for the com.google.inject:guice is the com.google.guava:guava:[25.1-android](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.google.guava/guava/25.1-android), which con.google.common.collect ImmutableMap class only accept up to 10 arguments, instead of the 12 required ones during the `mvn test` phase.

Until an official fix is released, you can use this workaround:

In your local Maven repository (by default, _$HOME/.m2/repository_) edit the **com/google/inject/guice/4.2.1/guice-4.2.1.pom** file and change the parent.version from `4.2.1` to `5.1.0`. Then perform again the `mvn install` phase and that's all!


# Test execution and report

Launch the specific `mvn integration-test` phase and check the output result in a HTML format in the [target/jbehave/view/rgl_practice.stories.JBehave.html](target/jbehave/view/rgl_practice.stories.JBehave.html) test report file.
